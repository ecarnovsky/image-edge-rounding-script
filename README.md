# Image Edge Rounding Script
This script rounds the edge of images. What is removed from the edges is replaced with transparency. The RADIUS variable at the top of main.py can be adjusted to control the amount rounded. Running the script will take all png/jpg/jpeg out of input_images, round their edges, then save the resulting images in output_images.
